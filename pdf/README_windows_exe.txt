# To package your Python GUI app as a Windows .exe, use PyInstaller.
# 1. Install PyInstaller (on Windows):
#     pip install pyinstaller
# 2. From a Windows command prompt, run:
#     pyinstaller --onefile --windowed pdf_normalizer_gui.py
#
# This will create a standalone .exe in the 'dist' folder.
#
# If you want to include all dependencies and make it portable, run the above command on a Windows machine with all dependencies installed.
#
# If you want to customize the icon, add: --icon=youricon.ico
#
# For best results, copy this script and your .py files to a Windows PC and run PyInstaller there.
